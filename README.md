# Risk-management
In this repository. Me and my friend in code will build a trading bot in python. But will also do forecasting in R and risk management also in R to open positions and take utilities
This repository will not accept anithing from anyone that used the bot for analysis. They are just to build a strong portfolio not to give trading singals. We do not will accept by any circumstance resposability.
The different analysis are with static data so it can get outdated. We do not share resposability.
This is public to use, you can reply re code for yourself but we will not accept contributions from anyone outside the team.
You can improve the code or analysis for you own repository or fork.
If you're a business or want to contact us you are free to do it.
We are not professionals at risk management we are just trying to improve our coding skills and build something for us.
